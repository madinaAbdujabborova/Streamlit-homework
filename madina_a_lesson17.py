This dataset aims to shed light on the nutritional value of these fast food products, helping consumers make more informed decisions about their food choices. With information on calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein, and other key nutrients, this dataset provides a valuable resource for nutritionists, researchers, and health-conscious individuals.
